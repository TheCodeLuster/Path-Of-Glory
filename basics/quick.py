### quick intro to roadmap (Python) ###

# off docs: https://docs.python.org/3/
# learn history of language

"""

high-level interpreted lang (release - 1991) `Guido van Rossum`

...

"""

# learn what interpreted is and why C/C++ is NOT: (below is a hint)

"""
basically, it reads and executes your code directly, one line at a time
"""

# decide why you need this (for what purpose)

"""

backend (server-side apps), big data, data science, ML/AI, etc...


"""

## section 1 ##
# ---

## learn the basics
# basic syntax
"""

This is just a set of rules that we use to create a Python program.
    Python uses indentations (to indicate a block od code)

"""
## 1 point:
# Vars and data types
"""
Vars (variables) - containers 
they store info (create with `=`)
you can name them as you want
also learn about `self-documenting code` or `Python clean code`
"""

var_to_store_a_number = 15
var_to_store_a_string = 'Hi!'
...

# We also have a comments where you can write anything you want
# the interpreter won't read this in your code
# often uses for documentation of code

# <- single line comment

"""
also this is multiline comment
...
"""

# we have math (number)
#3 => 3 
#...
# Math is just math

8 - 1 # => 7
2 * 3 # => 6
...

# Kinda more:
a = 1 + 1 == 2 # => True
b = 2 + 3 == 1 # => False
print(a, b) # => True False in console

# So 2 new things:
# `=` - this is assign operator
# `==` - this is equality operator
